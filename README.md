# FizzBuzz
## Over engineered FizzBuzz

This is a C# .NET Core console application that prints out the numbers 1 - 100.  If the number is a multiple of three, it prints out "Fizz", a multiple of five prints out "Buzz", a multiple of seven prints out "Wizz", and a multiple of eleven prints out "Bang."  The number fifteen would print out "FizzBuzz", the number 33 would print out "FizzBang", and the number 70 would print out "BuzzWizz", etc.

## Places for improvement:
One potential improvement is to allow the user to input the start and stop numbers as well as the multiples and string replacements as parameters.  An even better improvement would be to have a GUI input for each of the values.
